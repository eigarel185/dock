# PHP Web Application

This is a PHP web application containerized with Docker for easy deployment on platforms like Render.

## Project Structure

- `index.php`: Main entry point
- `Dockerfile`: Container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Local development setup
- Various PHP files and assets

## Local Development

To run the application locally with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then access your application at http://localhost:8080

## Pushing to GitHub

Follow these steps to push this repository to GitHub:

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 2. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Click the '+' icon in the top right and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository
4. Leave it as a public repository (or choose private if preferred)
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click 'Create repository'

### 3. Link and Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show commands similar to these. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name:

```bash
# Link your local repository to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
# OR if your default branch is 'main'
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify

Visit your GitHub repository URL to confirm your code has been pushed successfully.

## Deploying to Render

1. Push your code to GitHub using the steps above
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select "Docker" as the environment
5. Render will automatically detect and use your Dockerfile

## Notes

- Make sure you have Git installed and configured with your GitHub credentials
- If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to use a personal access token instead of a password
